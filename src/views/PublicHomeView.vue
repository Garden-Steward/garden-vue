          <p>Garden Steward is a community-driven, open-source project developing SMS-first software for managing volunteer events, watering schedules, and harvest coordination. Since 2022, we've partnered with the Oakland Urban Farming Project (OUFP) to organize urban agricultural initiatives.</p>
          <p>We believe the best way to achieve the fastest change is a cooperative approach. Each SMS phone number is it's own cooperative of local gardening projects. If you're in Oakland please join our existing cooperative. Otherwise, you can partner with us, and add to our cooperative network!</p>
