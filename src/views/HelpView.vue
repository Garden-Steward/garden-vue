            <h2 class="text-xl pb-2">How do I use Garden Steward?</h2>
            <p>Garden Steward is an SMS app for managing communal gardens. For most users all you need to do is sign up to a garden, and Garden Steward will send you reminders of volunteer days. Garden Steward also manages tasks for the garden, if you're ever confused you can respond: OPTIONS.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h2 class="text-xl pb-2">Do I need to reply in ALL CAPS?</h2>
            <p>No! Garden Steward is case insensitive. We use caps to be clear what commands are accepted. So if you reply 'yes' or 'no' you will be understood.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h2 class="text-xl pb-2">How do I sign up to a garden?</h2>
            <p>You can sign up to a garden by messaging Garden Steward with the garden name. If the garden is not already in your account, Garden Steward will add it for you. The last garden name you SMS will be your "Active Garden"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h2 class="text-xl pb-2">I want to STOP receiving texts</h2>
            <p>You can do that by messaging Garden Steward with STOP. Our app will remove you from all gardens and our SMS partner Twilio will make sure you no longer receive texts from our app even if we try.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="text-2xl pt-5">Managing Tasks</h3>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h2 class="text-xl pb-2">I have been assigned a task I can't do</h2>
            <p>That's fine! NO, and SKIP are the most popular options. With NO you will get a list of other volunteers you can then reassign the task to. If you feel the task doesn't need to be done, you can reply SKIP.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mt-4">
            <h2 class="text-xl pb-2">I'm about to go on Vacation</h2>
            <p>That's fine! Garden Steward will pause your account from getting tasks, just message VACATION. When you return, just message Garden Steward with BACK.</p>
